XOS Win11 v009 POST INSTALLATION SCRIPT

Alright here it is but wtf Imribiy?! Why would you name "iesetup.exe" your POST INSTALLATION SCRIPT. Also next time maybe don't put this code in a leftover.bat or even if you do just obfuscate it ffs let it be challenging!

```
del /f "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iesetup.exe" 
del /f /q "C:\Leftover.bat" 
exit /b
```

ANYWAYS FOLKS! ENJOY AND FEEL FREE TO FORK IT!
